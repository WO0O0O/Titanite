# Titanite — Development Phases

## Phase 1: Planning and Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create project documentation (`docs/` folder).
- [x] Initialize Next.js (App Router) project with Tailwind CSS.
- [x] Install core dependencies (Zustand, TanStack Query, Lucide Icons, Recharts).
- [x] Finalize architecture, API strategy, and data models.
- [x] Install `yahoo-finance2` package.
- [x] Create `.env.local` with T212 and Finnhub key placeholders.

## Phase 2: Core UI Scaffold & Theming ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Define the strict "Bloomberg Terminal" dark theme via Tailwind v4 `@theme` in `globals.css`.
- [x] Create base layout: fixed `Header`, fixed `Sidebar`, `TerminalWindow` content wrapper.
- [x] `providers.tsx` — client-side `QueryClientProvider` keeping root layout a Server Component.
- [x] `HeaderClock.tsx` — isolated client component (smallest client boundary pattern).
- [x] Stub pages for all 4 routes: `/dashboard`, `/builder`, `/intel`, `/congress`.

## Phase 3: State Management & Mock Prototype Logic ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] All TypeScript types created in `src/types/` (signals, holdings, market, intel, congress).
- [x] `METRIC_REGISTRY` created in `src/lib/metrics/registry.ts` — scalable, 8 initial metrics.
- [x] Mock data created for market, holdings, Master Signals, intel, congress.
- [x] `signalEvaluator.ts` — pure evaluator with static, crossover, and metric-vs-metric logic.
- [x] `signalStore.ts` — Zustand store with CRUD, evaluateAll, and derived selectors.
- [x] `uiStore.ts` — Zustand store for UI state (selected signal, Warsh toggle).
- [x] UI primitives: `Badge`, `ProgressMeter`, `StatusDot`.
- [x] Signal Builder fully built: `MetricSelector`, `ConditionRow`, `SignalEditor`, `MasterSignalList`, `BuilderContent`.
- [x] `/builder` page updated — Server Component shell wrapping client `BuilderContent`.

## Phase 4: Dashboard, Intel Hub & Congress Tracker UI ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] `MacroPillarsBar.tsx` — 4-pillar strip (TNX, VIX, SPX vs 200MA, Warsh toggle).
- [x] `MasterSignalCard.tsx` — Signal card with progress meter, condition list, edit link.
- [x] `HoldingsTable.tsx` — Dense portfolio table with colour-coded P&L.

- [x] Mock data: `intelFeed.mock.ts`, `congress.mock.ts`.
- [x] All 4 pages (`/dashboard`, `/intel`, `/congress`, `/builder`) fully functional with mock data.

## Phase 5: API Integration & Real Data Layer ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] `src/lib/utils/ema.ts` — Pure EMA calculator (periods 9/21/50/200), seeded with SMA.
- [x] `src/lib/services/yahooFinance.service.ts` — Parallel fetches + EMA computation, mock fallback.
- [x] `src/lib/services/trading212.service.ts` — T212 REST API client, ticker normalisation, mock fallback.
- [x] `src/lib/services/congress.service.ts` — Senate + House Watcher feeds, normalised to `CongressTrade`.
- [x] `src/lib/services/finnhub.service.ts` — Finnhub general news, keyword sentiment heuristic.
- [x] Route Handlers: `/api/market`, `/api/portfolio`, `/api/congress`, `/api/intel`.
- [x] TanStack Query hooks: `useMarketData`, `useHoldings`, `useCongressTrades`, `useIntelFeed`.
- [x] `DashboardContent`, `IntelContent`, `CongressContent` updated to use hooks.
- [x] `evaluateAll()` called automatically when live market data loads.

### Phase 5.1: Bug Fixes & Data Accuracy ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Congress service: corrected S3 URLs + `User-Agent` header + `cache: 'no-store'`.
- [x] `yahoo-finance2` v3: fixed class instantiation breaking change.
- [x] Holdings VALUE column: live `USDGBP=X` FX conversion (GBP per position).
- [x] P&L% column: fixed cross-currency bug → `(currentPrice - avgPrice) / avgPrice`.
- [x] 24H% column: removed misleading all-time-gain proxy → shows `N/A`.
- [x] Currency: all `$` → `£`, `en-US` → `en-GB`.

---

## Phase 5.5: Housekeeping & Stability ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Fix Intel page crash — `MOCK_FED_WATCH_ITEMS is not defined` (stale `.next/` cache, cleared on rebuild).
- [x] Fix `yahoo-finance2` deprecation — migrated `historical()` → `chart()`. Added `suppressNotices`.
- [x] Congress tab — Coming Soon stub with greyed-out sidebar nav item (`SOON` badge).

---

## Phase 6: Web Intelligence Layer ✅ COMPLETE (Phase 6a)
- [x] `rss.service.ts` — 6 targeted Google News RSS feeds (no extra dependencies).
- [x] Feeds: `short-research` (Wolfpack/Hindenburg/Citron), `ft-tech` (Financial Times), `power-wall`, `capex-watch`, `lead-time`, `deferred-delivery`.
- [x] Company→ticker auto-tagging from headline text.
- [x] Improved `deriveSentiment` — consistent across Finnhub and RSS, extended bearish phrases for supply-chain signals.
- [x] Intel API route — merges Finnhub + RSS in parallel, deduplicates, sorts newest-first.
- [x] Signal filter row in `IntelContent` — `ALL SIGNALS | POWER WALL | CAPEX | LEAD TIME | DEFERRED`.
- [x] Signal tag badges in `IntelItemRow` — amber tags showing which macro signal an article is evidence for.
- [x] Uniform timestamp format — `17 May 05:01` for all items.

## Phase 7: Discord Notifications ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] `discord.service.ts` — Pure server-side service. Builds rich Discord embeds and POSTs to webhook URL from env.
- [x] Alert gating: `signal.alertEnabled` AND at least one `condition.alertEnabled` must both be true before a notification fires.
- [x] Embed includes: signal name, logic mode, per-condition status (✅/⬜), completion summary, London timestamp.
- [x] Batching: up to 10 embeds per Discord message; multiple batches if needed.
- [x] `/api/evaluate` route — cron-callable `GET` handler. Fetches live market data, evaluates all signals, fires Discord for triggered+alertEnabled signals. Falls back to mock context if Yahoo Finance fails.
- [x] `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` added to `.env.local` and documented in `AI_CONTEXT.md`.
- [x] `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` ensures the evaluate route is never cached.

> **Cron setup:** Hit `GET /api/evaluate` on a schedule using [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) (free). Recommended: every 15 minutes, Mon–Fri, 08:00–17:00 London time.
> **Phase 9 upgrade path:** Replace `MOCK_MASTER_SIGNALS` seed in `evaluate/route.ts` with a Supabase query — nothing else changes.

- [x] Update research `workflow.md` documentation covering all three active frameworks (sc, leopold, and space).
